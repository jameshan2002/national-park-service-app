## Project Details
I have made a deployable web app using the National Park Service API allowing users to have the best National Park experience possible with an intuitive, easy-to-navigate interface.


## List of Tools Used
- National Park Service API
- Javascript
- React JS
- Sass


## List of Packages Used
- React-Reveal
- React-Router
- Font-Awesome


## Required Features
1. Let visitors search from a list of activities to do at different National Parks
   - Visitors can click an activity and have the web app display all the National Parks tied to a specific activity.
   - After selecting a specific park, the app should pull up an informational page so the visitor can learn more about the park.

2. Have a feature on the web app where visitors can: 
   - Retrieve data from park web cams based on which National Park(s) the user selects. 
   - Specifically, this feature should be able to display the non-streaming images collected from park web cams so a visitor can view them with ease.


## Extra Features
- It will recommend parks from the home page by randomly selecting 3 parks from the API database and show it on the recommendation section.
- Made an “about” section showing the National Park informations.
